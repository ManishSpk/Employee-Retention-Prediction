Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital, time and skills. Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring. Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate. The objective of this project is to develop a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit.
